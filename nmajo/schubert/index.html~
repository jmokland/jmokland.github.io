<h1>The schubert package for Maple</h1>


<p>
This Maple package for computations with Chern classes in intersection
rings was written by Sheldon Katz and Stein Arild Strømme from 1992
and onwards, and
has been revised and updated to reflect new versions of Maple by
Jan-Magnus Økland.</p>

<p>
You may download source code and rudimentary documentation <a href="http://stromme.uib.no/schubert/schubert.tar">here</a>.
</p>


<p>However, this Maple package is no longer actively supported, and current
efforts have moved from Maple to Macaulay2: <br>

    port of schubert to <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/Macaulay2/">Macaulay2</a>.
